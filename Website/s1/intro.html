        <h4>So what does it take to be a website developer?</h4>
        <p>Website development is a constantly changing landscape, with new technologies and frameworks being developed constantly. As such, developers must stay on top of these changes and new innovations to stay up-to-date. On top of this, website developers must become problem solvers using a plethora of tools. We'll look further into these tools later. For now, let's get familiar with the concepts.</p>
        <h4>What will we be learning?</h4>
        <p>This website will teach you the basics of <strong>front-end development</strong>. As opposed to web design, front-end development is the implementation of a website mock-up, or design, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Front-end development focuses on building for the <strong>client</strong>. Back-end development is the implementation of the website logic and data-based structure, and the linking of these elements with the client. Back-end development focuses on building for the <strong>server</strong>.</p>
        <h4>Terminology</h4>
        <p>The current technology stack for publishing websites on the internet is composed of multiple pieces. The most common and basic stack is HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HTML</strong> - <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> - is the standard <strong>markup language</strong> for creating web pages and applications. As a markup language, HTML is used to define the structure of a webpage. The current version that people build for is HTML5.</li>
          <li><strong>CSS</strong> - <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em> - are used to style the HTML structure of a website. This is the standard language for creating all of the beautiful layouts, designs, effects, and some animations that happens on webpages. The current version that people build for is CSS3.</li>
          <li><strong>JS</strong> - <em>JavaScript</em> - is the <strong>programming language</strong> used by web browsers. Logic is written in JavaScript to provide interactivity between users and the web page, among other functionalities.</li>
          <li><strong>Client</strong> - The end-user's browser. This can be Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc. Most modern browsers support the latest CSS3 specifications, but it is important to note that you may experience some differences in how your webpage is rendered based which browser you're using.</li>
          <li><strong>Server</strong> - This is where your website is stored and hosted (when not working locally), and where databases are built and stored. We won't go too in depth into working on the server, but you should understand what it is and why it is important.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While each of these tools is a separate language with different syntactic workings, it is necessary to use them together to build a full-fledged website. However, we will ignore JavaScript for now, as we are more interested in the assembly of webpages using HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>This graphic below should help show the difference between front-end and back-end. The front-end (client side) is made up of HTML, CSS, and JS. The items linked to our main web stack here, such as Bootstrap are frameworks, or libraries, that contain useful code to make working with those technologies easier. You need not worry about these for now, but we will touch on some of them later.</p>
